# Java Ciphers Project

## Overview
The **Java Ciphers Project** is a collection of encryption and decryption algorithms implemented in Java. It provides multiple cipher techniques to encode and decode messages securely.

## Features
- **CaesarShift and CaesarKey**: Implements a simple shift cipher for encryption and decryption.
- **Substitution Cipher**: Replaces characters based on a predefined mapping.
- **Combined Cipher**: Utilizes multiple encryption techniques for enhanced security.
- **Client Class**: Provides an interface for users to input messages and choose encryption or decryption methods.
- **Testing Class**: Includes unit tests to validate the correctness of the encryption and decryption functions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javaciphers.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd javaciphers
   ```

## Usage
Compile and run the client program to encrypt or decrypt messages:
```sh
javac Client.java
java Client
```

## Testing
To run unit tests, execute:
```sh
javac Testing.java
java Testing
```
